Nehru, seeking to conduct polygraph tests on 13 suspects was adjourned to November 7 by a Judicial Magistrate court here on Tuesday.  Summons had been issued to the 13 suspects by the Judicial Magistrate Court - VI recently based on the petition filed by the SIT. The Court had directed the 13 suspects to appear before it on Tuesday in order to obtain their consent for undergoing the polygraph tests. Twelve of the suspects were involved in murder cases at various places. One of them was a prisoner lodged in the Central Prison at Cuddalore, who was brought with police escort to be produced at the the Court. SIT officers and the counsels of the suspects were present when the petition came up for hearing on Tuesday morning. The court asked the SIT to file an affidavit and adjourned the hearing to November 7.  A counsel who appeared for one of the suspects later told reporters outside the court that a Deputy Superintendent of Police of the SIT had filed the petition in the court instead of a Superintendent of Police and he had raised an objection on this. The counsel wondered as to how the SIT had arrived at the list of suspects to conduct the polygraph test.  The Madras High Court had in February this year ordered that a SIT be constituted to conduct probe into the 2012 murder of Ramajeyam at Tiruchi. The High Court had also said that it would monitor the investigation conducted by the SIT headed by Superintendent of Police Jeyakumar. The body of Mr. Ramajeyam, a businessman who had dealt in granite mining and real estate, was found on the banks of Cauvery river near Tiruvalarsolai on the outskirts of Tiruchi on March 29, 2012. The circumstances indicated that he was murdered after being abducted apparently when he went out for a morning walk. The case which was initially investigated by the Tiruchi City police was subsequently transferred to the Crime Branch - CID which was unable to achieve a breakthrough till 2017. Subsequently, the investigation was transferred to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on an application filed by Latha Ramajeyam, wife of the deceased. However, the CBI too could not achieve any headway in the murder case forcing the family members of Ramajeyam to make another application for the constitution of a SIT. The SIT had conducted enquiries with several persons, including members of the family of Ramajeyam.  Published - November 01, 2022 07:44 pm IST"

Tiruchi Superintendent of Police Sujit Kumar said he was reviewing the progress made by the special teams daily and expressed hope that the case would be cracked at the earliest. The Uppiliyapuram case is one among the 18 cases of murder reported under Tiruchi Rural Police limits since January. Breakthrough has been achieved in 17 of them. Sudden provocation after a wordy quarrel and previous motive have been cited as reasons in most of the murder cases. Property disputes, family feuds and illegal intimacy have also been cited as other reasons for the murders. The police have categorised the motives behind the murders under different heads, including family dispute, wordy quarrel, drunken brawl, revenge and other reasons. Police statistics reveal that sudden provocation after a wordy quarrel was the reason for five murders. Previous motive led to five other murders. Family dispute was the cause of three murders and three others were committed due to property disputes. Illegal intimacy was cited as the reason in one murder case, police sources said.

Acting on a complaint from the youth, B. Naveen, of Poovalur in Pattukottai taluk, the Vattathikottai police booked a case under under Sections 302 (murder) and 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence) of the Indian Penal Code against the victim’s father Perumal, of Neivaviduthi, and some of his relatives. Perumal, along with some of his relatives, had allegedly cremated the body of his daughter Iswarya after murdering her on January 3.  According to the complainant, he and Iswarya, who both worked at a textile unit at Avarapalayam in Tiruppur district, were in love with each other. Mr. Naveen claimed he ‘married’ her (since he is underaged, the marriage is legally void) at a temple in Avarapalayam after he learned that her father was visiting Tiruppur with the intention of “separating them.” The couple later left for Veerapandi on January 1 and stayed in a rented house there.  Meanwhile, Perumal lodged a complaint with the Palladam police stating that his daughter had gone missing. The police had reportedly traced Iswarya and handed her over to Perumal on January 2. When Mr. Naveen returned to his native, he came to know from his friends that Iswarya had been murdered by her father and relatives. The police are on the lookout for Perumal and some of of his relatives.   Published - January 09, 2024 12:58 am IST"

But the tower has actually been named after a Devadasi called Vellayi who had sacrificed her life to protect the idol of Namperumal from the Sultanate forces who had invaded the temple. Srirangam was attacked by the Sultanate forces in the year 1323 during the Tamil month of Vaikasi. Nearly, 12,000 residents of Srirangam island had laid down their lives fighting to protect the temple. The forces attacked the temple and Lord Ranganatha's jewels and the temple gold were taken away. The forces also wanted to seize the idol of Namperumal, which they believed was made of pure ‘Abaranji' gold. They searched for the idol but the Vaishnavite Acharya, Pillailokacharya had taken the idol away and fled to Madurai. (The idol of Namperumal that left Srirangam in 1323 returned back only in 1371). Unable to locate the idol, the Sultanate forces killed the temple authorities and later launched a massive hunt for Pillailokacharya and Namperumal. Fearing that the forces would capture the Acharya and the idol, Vellayi, performed a dance before the commander of the forces thus gaining time for Pillailokacharya to escape with the idol. Her dance lasted for hours together and finally she took the commander to the eastern gopuram and pushed him down. After killing him, Vellayi jumped to her death from the tower chanting the name of Ranganathar. Hailing Vellayi's sacrifice, the chief of Vijayanagara forces, Kempanna, who drove away the Sultanate forces, named the tower after her. The gopuram continues to be painted white in her memory.

In May that year, another night watchman at an engineering firm near Iyer Hospital on Trichy Road, Umamaheswaran (34) was murdered. His bike and Rs. 10,000 in cash was stolen. The police said that they had examined more than 570 ex-convicts and suspects in connection with the case, but are yet to crack the case. In December the same year, Sarasammal (80) was found dead amid thorny bushes near Ukkadam Bypass road and her gold jewellery was missing. The only unresolved murder in the city in which there was no theft of valuables and for which the reason remains a mystery is that of college student T. Arnold (21) who was found dead in an abandoned small building on the Brooke Bond Road, on August 19, 2014. He suffered a stab on his neck inflicted with a broken glass bottle.

Terming Guna as a dangerous element, Mr. Yadav told presspersons here that investigation was on to find out those who had been supporting and harbouring Guna who was involved in “katta panchayat”. The police were on the look out for Guna who was on the run for one year and had been constantly changing his SIM cards, Mr. Yadav said. The police received intelligence information about the rowdy moving with a pistol causing concern that he could breach peace and create insecurity. A couple of days ago, Guna had extorted money from a person by name Prabhakaran at Woraiyur and a case was booked against him in this connection, he said. Five warrants were pending against him — three in city police limits, one in Tiruchi district, and one in Chengalpattu. Noting that Guna’s arrest was a good catch, Mr. Yadav said the timing was right as the rowdy could have been used for settling scores during the election period. The pistol used by Guna was bought from a person in Villupuram, the Commissioner said. Although the pistol was a country made weapon, it had a good calibre and was as good as an original weapon of that kind, he said. Stating that the city police had been going after anti-social elements, he said eight rowdies were arrested in the last one month and sent for remand.

      "content": "February 22 was an important day for the judicial officers and advocates of Tiruchi district. It was on this day in 1916 that H.O.D. Harding, the District and Sessions Judge of the erstwhile Trichinopoli, was murdered by a convict for a judgement he delivered, minutes before boarding a chariot on the court campus. The English judge from London had assumed office in October 1913. The judge, known for his uprightness, had convicted an accused to life sentence in a murder case. The accused, who was subsequently granted bail by the High Court, reached Trichinopoli court with a deadly weapon and attacked Harding. The judge died on the spot. Later, his body was flown to London. A monument was erected on the court premises in recognition of his service and every year on February 22 judicial officers and lawyers assemble at the memorial to pay their respects to the slain judge. This year too, P.Velmurugan, Principal District and Sessions Judge, along with Poornima, First Additional District Judge, A.R. Rahman, Second Additional District Judge, Balachandar, Chief Judicial Magistrate, and members of the Bar, placed a wreath at the memorial.

      "content": "A 21-year-old man was arrested on Friday, May 3, 2024, for allegedly murdering his mother and grandfather by serving them chicken rice laced with poison.  S. Bhagavathi (21), a third-year engineering student at a private college, had on April 30, purchased chicken rice from a restaurant near the Namakkal Bus Stand and served it to seven family members at his residence in Devarayapuram, Namakkal district. Following the meal, his mother S. Nathiya (41) and grandfather Shanmugam alias Shanmuganathan (67) fell seriously ill and were admitted to Namakkal Government Hospital, where Shanmuganathan passed away on Thursday night (May 2), while Nathiya succumbed on Friday evening (May 3). In response, the Namakkal district administration sealed the restaurant and sent food samples for laboratory analysis. Subsequently, the Namakkal police filed a case and while interrogating Bhagavathi, found that his statements were inconsistent. Further investigation revealed that Bhagavathi was struggling with drug addiction, and faced with incessant scrutinising by his mother and grandfather into his addiction, allegedly laced the chicken rice with poison and served it to them.

      "title": "Murder, he wrote",
      "content": " For someone whose career has spanned three decades in banking and the corporate sector, it is quite natural that R.V. Raman chose corporate India for his first novel, Fraudster: The Story of Corporate India's Black Sheep . But there’s more to it, he explains, “I started writing fantasy at first, to see if I could write something that’d interest Indian readers, at which point I realised that there was no market for fantasy. I looked around and saw that the corporate arena was doing rather well. So I went to bookstores and found that nobody writes on fiction in corporate India and that’s when I decided to go with this.”  So does that mean Raman was inspired by something that happened in real life in corporate India? “That’s an overstatement. Crime fiction is about the dark side of people, and while I’ve written about corporate India, it doesn’t mean all of it is dark. The characters are from the corporate world; the outlook to life is reasonably stereotypical to certain groups,” he says. Fraudster , broadly, is an insider account of a white-collar crime. It follows the murder of a young banker who is found dead after she deposes before a commission investigating large-scale financial fraud. Soon, two more murders follow and a high-security server room of a multinational accounting firm is hacked. While the book does have many characters, which may seem confusing, the narrative is fast-paced and has quite a bit of jargon that some may find difficult to comprehend.  This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. Raman, who is currently the visiting faculty for Business Strategy at IIM, Trichy, says that simplifying the terminology was a big challenge while writing the book. “Even with terms like private equity, debit and credit, many of us get confused. And with terminology, one word can mean five sentences. It took me almost two months to simplify all the jargon I used and, at one point, Hachette told me not to simplify it too much as readers will want to check out terms themselves, and that would be more impactful,” Raman says. With the country just opening up to thriller and crime fiction, Raman says that the idea of a corporate thriller, however, is an underused arena: “I toyed with the idea of writing a Christie-like mystery, but I wanted to do it differently; to do something I could hang my hat on. And corporate India has an entire spectrum of human emotions like ambition, frustration and greed.” While Raman says his inspirations are Arthur Conan Doyle, Frederick Forsythe and Agatha Christie, science fiction and fantasy are also genres that Raman finds fascinating and that’s why he has self-published two books on fantasy under a pseudonym. Raman is currently working on his second book, another corporate thriller, but, set in the world of the stock exchange.  Fraudster: The Story of Corporate India's Black Sheep by R.V. Raman is available on Amazon at Rs. 250.  Published - October 14, 2014 06:06 pm IST  books and literature / The Hindu MetroPlus "
