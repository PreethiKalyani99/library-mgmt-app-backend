Residents of Srirangam call this east tower as the Vellai Gopuram. It is generally believed that the tower is so called since it has been painted white by the temple authorities. But the tower has actually been named after a Devadasi called Vellayi who had sacrificed her life to protect the idol of Namperumal from the Sultanate forces who had invaded the temple. Srirangam was attacked by the Sultanate forces in the year 1323 during the Tamil month of Vaikasi. Nearly, 12,000 residents of Srirangam island had laid down their lives fighting to protect the temple. The forces attacked the temple and Lord Ranganatha's jewels and the temple gold were taken away. The forces also wanted to seize the idol of Namperumal, which they believed was made of pure ‘Abaranji' gold. They searched for the idol but the Vaishnavite Acharya, Pillailokacharya had taken the idol away and fled to Madurai. (The idol of Namperumal that left Srirangam in 1323 returned back only in 1371). Unable to locate the idol, the Sultanate forces killed the temple authorities and later launched a massive hunt for Pillailokacharya and Namperumal. Fearing that the forces would capture the Acharya and the idol, Vellayi, performed a dance before the commander of the forces thus gaining time for Pillailokacharya to escape with the idol. Her dance lasted for hours together and finally she took the commander to the eastern gopuram and pushed him down. After killing him, Vellayi jumped to her death from the tower chanting the name of Ranganathar. Hailing Vellayi's sacrifice, the chief of Vijayanagara forces, Kempanna, who drove away the Sultanate forces, named the tower after her. The gopuram continues to be painted white in her memory.

He said that in a few cases, the investigation officers who had handled these cases sometime ago, have come forward to reinvestigate them. These were murders committed between 2003 and 2014 in the city. “Eight of these murders, including a triple murder, were for robbing gold valuables. The police have detected all murders that were committed from the year 2007 to 2013,” the officer added. And, they were trying to probe if any of the recently nabbed accused were involved in the long-pending cases in this period. According to Crime Records Bureau data, the oldest undetected murder is a triple murder at Balan Nagar near Masakalipalayam on March 3, 2003. The accused murdered Amirtham, her daughter Geetha (26) and her granddaughter Ranjani (2) in their house and fled with two chains weighing eight sovereigns. In September the same year, another murder was reported at Ganapathy. In this incident, Shyla’s (44) throat was slit and her four sovereign gold chain was stolen. In both the cases, the police had secured a couple of unverifiable fingerprints from the crime scene. A three kg gold jewellery was taken away by two armed persons who waylaid Ravi (43), an employee of a jewellery outlet, who was a pillion rider and was on his way to board a train to Chennai on November 27, 2005. There were three unresolved murders in 2006. On February 25, Natarajan (52), night watchman at a jewellery outlet on Mettupalayam Road, was strangulated and 50 sovereigns gold jewellery was stolen from the shop. In May that year, another night watchman at an engineering firm near Iyer Hospital on Trichy Road, Umamaheswaran (34) was murdered. His bike and Rs. 10,000 in cash was stolen. The police said that they had examined more than 570 ex-convicts and suspects in connection with the case, but are yet to crack the case. In December the same year, Sarasammal (80) was found dead amid thorny bushes near Ukkadam Bypass road and her gold jewellery was missing.

Arnold (21) who was found dead in an abandoned small building on the Brooke Bond Road, on August 19, 2014. He suffered a stab on his neck inflicted with a broken glass bottle.

Mani of Karungulam near Vaiyampatti in Tiruchi district, according to a press statement.  Preliminary investigations revealed that Mani had an extra-marital affair with a married woman, B. Mookayee from Karungulam. Police said that they were distant relatives.  Mookayee had sent Mani to get money from V. Balasubramanian, 45 of Karur with whom she had an illicit relationship earlier. But Balasubramanian had given money to Mani to kill Mookayee’s husband as he was objecting to their affair.  Balasubramanian got angry with Mani who instead of executing the hatched plan had befriended her husband.  Hence, Balasubramanian took Mani to Kollapatti in Gujiliamparai and hacked him to death. Later he tied the hands, put the body in a gunny bag and threw it into a stone quarry. The crime was carried out along with his son, B. Bharat Raj, 19 and friend P. Suresh, 42.

      "content": "Mystery behind murder of Zakir Hussain, 51, of Kattur, a businessman, whose charred body was found inside a car that was gutted in a reserve forest on Thachankurichi - Reddimangudi Road near Siruganur on Wednesday was unravelled.  The body was completely burnt and the vehicle was entirely gutted. Special teams of the Tiruchi Rural Police detained four persons and found that dispute over money transaction was said to be the reason behind the murder. Superintendent of Police, Tiruchi, Ziaul Haque, and Deputy Inspector General of Police, Tiruchi Range, V. Balakrishnan, rushed to the scene and found the body, in the front seat, charred beyond recognition. The registration plate was also found to be burnt.  CCTV footages showed that the car had crossed Samayapuram toll plaza on Tuesday night and Thirumandurai toll plaza in Perambalur district later. The police learnt that Zakir Hussain had left home on Tuesday night after visiting his residence.  His cell phone call detail records were examined. It came to light that Zakir Hussain had left for Ramanatham in Cuddalore district, driving the car himself. The last call was made by Saravanan, a restaurant owner at Ramanatham, to whom he had given a big loan. Thereafter the cell phone was switched off. Saravanan lured Zakir Hussain to his restaurant by engaging a woman employee. The culprits accompanied Zakir Hussain in his car and escaped after murdering him and setting fire to the body along with the vehicle using petrol. Inspector General of Police V. Varadharaju said the special teams determined the motive behind the crime before detaining Saravanan, his brother Manikandan, Sakthi, a hotel employee, and Mohan. Mr. Ziaul Haque said the teams adopted a “multi-pronged” approach to achieve a breakthrough within hours. The gutted vehicle was brought to the Siruganur Police station for investigation.
